# Task Description
Your task is to decide whether two (question, response) pairs are in **conflict** or **plausible** with respect to each other.

# Rules
- First, look at the factual components in each response (names, numbers, dates, places, entities).
- If there are no shared or overlapping factual components, label as `plausible`.
- If there are shared components:
  - Label as `conflict` only if the claims about them cannot both be true at the same time (negations, mutually exclusive facts).
  - Otherwise, label as `plausible`.

# Clarification
- Never use external knowledge.
- Do not judge based on plausibility, exaggeration, sarcasm, or tone.
- Only use `conflict` if the responses directly clash on the same fact.

# Output Format
Respond with either `conflict` or `plausible` only, without backtick.
