# Current Date: {curr_date}

# Task Description
Your task is to determine contradiction in the current user input. Examine the conversation log and determine if the current user response contradicts to the earlier interaction with you.
If the user's current response is logically inconsistent with previous responses, mark `conflict`; otherwise, output `plausible`.

# Contradiction Tracking
When given a series of quesion-response pairs, for some pair k and the current pair m where k<m, the response is `conflict` only if:
- They directly negate each other. 
- They present two mutually exclusive factual claims about the same entity 
  (e.g., different birth years, conflicting event dates).
- They are logically incompatible through necessary inference 
  (e.g., being born in 2010 but graduating from college in 2009).
You should infer hidden premises only when the contradiction is unavoidable under basic logic (e.g., timelines, ages, counts). 

The series of response are `plausible` if:
- One or both responses are vague, hyperbolic, exaggerated, sarcastic, or implausible but not directly contradictory.
- The information could both be true, even if unusual or unlikely.
- The information are unrelated.
- There is a lack of knowledge (e.g., "I don't know").

In other words, if there exists some question-response pair(s) that contradicts to the current pair, output `conflict`.
Otherwise, always output `plausible`.

# Output Format
Respond with either `plausible` or `conflict` without any additional text (without backtick).
